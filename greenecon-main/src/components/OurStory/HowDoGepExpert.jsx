        Green Economy Partnership specializes in the dynamics of carbon trading.
        Carbon trading is a process that transforms carbon dioxide gas (CO2)
        into an economic commodity. How does the mechanism work? The state caps
        the amount of greenhouse gasses, particularly CO2, that could be emitted
        by each industrial sector which is where CO2 sensor technology monitors
        emissions.

      <p className="text-lg xl:w-8/12 mx-auto font-poppins text-[#3c3c3c] font-normal mt-4">
        Each year, industries are given individual quotas of CO2 emissions, and
        our carbon credit trading platforms help them throughout the process. It
        is through carbon trading that the government wants the businesses to
        opt for less polluting technologies, and persuades them in doing so. GEP
        experts help you reduce carbon emissions, calculate your carbon
        footprint, resulting in the reduction of global greenhouse gas
        emissions.
