          At Green Economy Partnership, We're driven by a strong desire to have
          a positive impact on nature, climate and energy. This is why we've
          created our Activate Approach, which envisions a more renewable-energy
          future, focused around sustainability and reducing the effects of
          climate change. Our goals are clearly outlined - becoming net zero in
          terms of emissions by 2050 and increasing renewable energy sources to
          power all of our facilities by then as well.

          We will focus on conserving forestry and maintaining healthy levels of
          greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. By implementing these measures
          now, we can be prepared for what lies ahead while also reducing our
          carbon footprint.
