        Partnering With the Uganda to Foster Carbon Offset Credits
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg lg:w-8/12 mx-auto font-poppins">
        The Green Economy is pleased to announce that it has signed an agreement
        with the Government of Uganda to develop the first set of Article 6.2
        compliant carbon credits. It is the most prominent milestone for our
        shared mission to promote international cooperation in combating climate
        change. The aim is to develop carbon offset methods that align with the
        agreement. This partnership established certified emission reduction
        standards, impacting the carbon credit price positively, hence,
        contributing toward the growth of the carbon credit market.
